## üìå Notes

- All routes follow RESTful conventions.
- Data must be sent and received as JSON.
- Endpoints are subject to authentication and may return `401 Unauthorized` if token validation fails.
- Was recently converted from a microservice architecture to an API so some route urls/logic will be having major changes soon...
